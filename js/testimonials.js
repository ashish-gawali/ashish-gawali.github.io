        quote: "Very soon after Ashish joined our group, straight from college, it was clear that he would become one of our best. Over the following two years, we came to know Ashish as a very professional, passionate, and hard-working developer. Ashish took upon himself assignments that normally require more experience. He has learned our solution domain in-depth and initiated activities without letting anything come in his way. Whether new technology, a new domain, or an unfamiliar activity – everything was a learning opportunity for Ashish which he took with great talent, enthusiasm, and a smile. Ashish is a great team player, always willing to help his teammates, taking above and beyond his formal responsibilities. Being very passionate and proud of his solution domain, Ashish was among our top professional blog authors. The number of inbound and outbound interactions in which he was involved was exceptional for the time of his service. I'd strongly recommend Ashish with a look forward to an opportunity to work with him again in the future."
