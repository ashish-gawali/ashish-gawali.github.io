        position: "Senior Software Tools Engineer",
        timeframe: "August 2021 - Present",
        description: `<p>During my time as a Senior Engineer in Software Tools at Analog Devices, I actively contributed to the journey of taking CodeFusion Studio from zero to 1—helping transform the platform and team from an idea with two people to a thriving organization of more than thirty. Along the way, I adapted to new challenges and collaborated with a diverse set of colleagues. My work focused on designing and delivering foundational systems such as the CFS package manager and significant VS Code extension features—including Zephyr integration, build and debug support, and command-line support for the package manager—which were critical to major product launches and the evolution of our developer ecosystem.</p>
