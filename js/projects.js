        description: "As part of the curriculum of Advanced Mobile Robotics developed a Emotion Support Robot along with Christof Fehrman, Tyler Haden and Pravardhan Reddy. Developed a Autonomous Emotional Support Robot using a ROSbot2.0 implementing Human-Robot Interaction. Devised the algorithm for the functionality of the robot. Aided in Human Detection and Human Emotion Recognition, Map creation using SLAM, and obstacle aviodance. Created simulation for the same in MATLAB and implemented it using ROS.",

        description: "The Shuttle Delivery Robot was developed as part of the ABU Robocon 2018. My responsibilities were to develop all of the electronic systems necessary to build the bot. The version that made it to the competetion was version 3. Each version had different actuators and approach. I designed the circuit boards necessary as well as wrote the code which was responsible to control the bot.",
